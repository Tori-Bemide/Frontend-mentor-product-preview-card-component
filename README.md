## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

So I learned a couple of things. This is the first project I've done using CSS Flexbox and as challenging as it is the end product is worth it.
Also found this code snippet really useful:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  width: 90vw;
  max-width: 350px;
}


### Continued development

Probably move on to CSS Grid next.

### Useful resources

- [HTML&CSS Tutorial and Projects Course (Flexbox&Grid) By John Smilga](https://www.udemy.com/course/in-depth-html-css-course-build-responsive-websites/) - This course is really good. Recommend for anyone interested in improving their html and css skills.
